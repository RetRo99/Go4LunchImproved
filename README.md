# Go4LunchImproved

App for organisation of lunch for working mates. User can pick a restaurant where he is going to eat and other users can see where
he is eating and can join him. Users can also rate the app. All the changes are seen in real time. Users login to app with Facebook, Twitter or Google account. I'm using Firebase for user authentication and FireStore for storing data.

App is created using Foursquare API to get location of nearby restaurants. To communicate with the API I'm using Retrofit with RxJava. 

Results of the query are posted in a map view. For mapview I'm using MapBox SDK.
